## _Predicting Monetary Damage Caused by Property Fires_NFIRS_

### **Project Description**

The goal of this project is to develop a predictive model to estimate the monetary damage caused by property fires. Specifically, linear regression models will be used to analyze historical fire data and identify the key factors that contribute to the severity of property damage, such as the type of property, location, time of day, and the response time of firefighters. The data has been extracted from National Fire Incident Reporting System (NFIRS) . The model will be trained and validated using a combination of supervised learning techniques and cross-validation methods. The ultimate objective is to build a model that can accurately estimate the monetary damages caused by a fire, which can be used by insurance companies and property owners to better assess the risks associated with fire damage and take appropriate mitigation measures.
